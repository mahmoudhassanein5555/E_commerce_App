# 🛒 Flutter E-Commerce App

A simple and clean E-Commerce mobile app UI built using **Flutter**, as a training project to apply what I’ve learned recently.

This project focuses on **design**, **navigation**, and **code organization** – all done manually without using any APIs (data is hardcoded for practice purposes).
